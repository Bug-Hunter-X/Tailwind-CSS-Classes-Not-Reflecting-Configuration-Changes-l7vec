// The solution is typically to rebuild your project to make sure Tailwind processes your config file
// For example:

// If you are using a build tool like Webpack or Vite, restart your dev server.
// If you are using a framework like Next.js, run `npm run build` or a similar command.
// If you're using create-react-app, simply restarting the server is usually enough.
// This ensures that the newly generated CSS files incorporate the updated configuration.

// Example of restarting the development server
console.log("Restart your development server to apply the Tailwind CSS changes.");
