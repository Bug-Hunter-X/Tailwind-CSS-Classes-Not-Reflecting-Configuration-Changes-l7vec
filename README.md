# Tailwind CSS Configuration Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Tailwind CSS: the failure of components to update their styles after changes to the Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`).

## Problem
After modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file (e.g., adding new plugins or customizing the theme), the changes are not reflected in the components using Tailwind CSS classes.  The components continue to render with the old styles.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the build process correctly incorporates the updated Tailwind CSS configuration and regenerates the necessary CSS files.  This may involve restarting the development server or running a build command specific to your project setup (e.g., `npm run build`).

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file. Add a new plugin or change existing settings.
3. Observe that the `MyComponent` in `bug.js` does not reflect the changes made in the configuration file.
4. Run the solution steps to fix the issue.
